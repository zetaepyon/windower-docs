This addon redirects the nm's weaknesses (VW or Abyssea) to the "tell" stream so that they can be held in the chat log using the chat filters' hold function (Config > Chat Filters > "Enter" on "Tell" until you get the green "hold" icon).
Moreover, the important informations are highlighted and a number is added to quickly understand the vulnerability level (1, 3, 5).

## Commands

### test
```
vwhl test
```

Fills the chat log with some messages to show how the plugin will work.
