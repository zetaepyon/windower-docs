This addon lets you input special chars using simple tags (ex.: `<note>` for â™ª). Using the pattern `<j:text>` any alphanumeric character will be replaced with its Japanese version. The available characters depend on the [data gathered by the windower team](https://github.com/Windower/Lua/blob/master/addons/libs/ffxidata.json).
