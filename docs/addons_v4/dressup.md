**Author:**  Cairthenn<br>
**Version:**  1.1<br>
**Date:** Nov. 11, 2015<br>

* Allows you to specify custom gear models for yourself, others, or individual players. Also allows for 1:1 model replacement similar to the functionality of .DAT swapping.
* Emulates BlinkMeNot functionality to prevent model blinking.
* **Uses packets**.

## Settings

* DressUp uses `settings.xml` in its data folder for all settings related to models and blinking.
* If you choose to edit this manually, this file uses **model IDs** for gear. You can look up the appropriate model IDs in the files in the main directory.

**Abbreviation:** `//du`

2. self/others/player <player name (if player was selected)> [race/face/<item slot>] [<item name>/<race name>/<face>]
  - Assigns models to yourself, others, or an individual player as specified.
  - Supports IDs as well as names for items/races. Specify male or female if necessary.
3. clear [self/others/player] <player name> [race/face/<item slot>]
	- Clears settings for the selection. Player name specific to player option.
