title: AutoRA
---

AutoRA simply causes ranged attacks to behave like the melee Auto-Attack while your weapon is drawn.  If no weapon is drawn or you put your weapon away, your ranged attacks will cease.

**Author:** Banggugyangu

**AUTHOR'S DISCLAIMER:** AutoRA will not consider any ammo you have equipped! **BE WARNED**.  If you have your equipment window open, spellcast 
**WILL NOT** change your ammo!!! I am not responsible for any lost ammo due to AutoRA.
