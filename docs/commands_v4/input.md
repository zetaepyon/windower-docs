Input commands allow you to control how Windower interacts with keyboard and mouse input, such as copy & paste and keybinds.

### bind / keyboard_bind
```
bind [modifier][state]<key> [up] <command>
keyboard_bind [modifier][state]<key> [up] <command>
```
Binds a command to a key.<br>
By default, binds activate on key press; specify `up` to bind on key release.

**Tip:** You can assign a command to multiple keys in a single statement by separating each key with a pipe (`|`) character.
