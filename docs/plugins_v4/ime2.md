IME restores support for the Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) in Final Fantasy XI, allowing you to type text in Japanese. 

In order to use it, Japanese language support must be installed, and Japanese must be selected as the default language for non-Unicode programs in Windows.

> **Note:** You may be able to use AppLocale-style programs such as Locale Emulator instead of setting the default non-Unicode language, but this is currently untested.

# Basic Usage

1. Configure the Japanese IME for [Windows 7](#config7) or [Windows 10](#config10).
1. Log into Final Fantasy XI and load the IME plugin.
1. Use the Windows language bar to change your language.
1. In the chat log, use the keyboard shortcut to change your input mode.

# Known Issues

There are several known issues when using the IME plugin for Windower 4:

* **Keyboard shortcuts to switch to Japanese do not seem to work.**

    For example, if you have keyboard layouts for German, English and Japanese installed, the typical **Alt**+**Shift** key combination to cycle languages will only switch between German and English. If you assign specific shortcuts, say **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**1** for German, **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**2** for English and **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**3** for Japanese, only the first two will work.

    > **Workaround:** Switch the language manually from the Windows language bar.

* **Keyboard shortcut to switch input modes does not work.**

    Even after manually selecting Japanese from the Windows language bar, you cannot change the input mode.

    > **Workaround:** Reconfigure the [input mode keyboard shortcut](#reconfigure-the-input-mode-keyboard-shortcut).

* **The input mode can get stuck in Japanese.**

    Occasionally, the input mode can get stuck and you won't be able to type in any keyboard layout other than Japanese.

    Because the Japanese *Romaji-Input* mode is similar to the English layout, you may want to stick with the Japanese layout and keep it in Romaji mode most of the time. You'll get used to it, and if you didn't want to use Japanese input anyways, why do you have the IME plugin loaded? It doesn't have to be on auto-load.
