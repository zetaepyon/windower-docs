In true fullscreen mode, you cannot use ALT + TAB ; it only gives you plugins and addons. How do I load a plugin? If the plugin name is FFXIDB , you have 3 options: * Enable the Find plugin in your Windower launcher profile. * Open the Windower console and type load ffxidb . * In the game chat log, type //load ffxidb . How do I load an addon? If the addon name is Clock , you have 3 options: * Enable the Clock addon in your Windower launcher profile. * Open the Windower console and type lua l clock . * In the game chat log, type //lua l clock .

The game crashes when I load a second character through Windower Windower alone cannot prevent issues related to FFXI trying to claim exclusive use of your graphics adapter. You can prevent crashes related to exclusive GPU use when multiboxing in a few ways. For example: * Change your Windows User Account Control (UAC) settings by lowering it at least one setting to prevent desktop dimming. To access the UAC settings, open the Start menu, type User Account Control , and choose Change User Account Control Settings . * Use a DirectX proxy that virtualizes your graphics adapter, such as DGVoodoo2.

The cape trader addon injects packets extensively so please take that into consideration and use this addon at you own risk. While there are some safeguards in this addon, there is still a risk that you can lose your abdhaljs thread,dust,sap and dye if you use this addon. Please read the usage notes and information on the prep and go commands carefully as well as the warnings section before deciding to use this addon. Usage notes Load the addon by using the following command: //lua load capetrader There are some conditions that you need to meet in order to use the important go and prep commands: You must be in Mhaura and be within a distance of 6 to the Gorpa-Masorpa npc. If you have recently zoned into Mhaura you will have to wait to use the go command until your inventory loads, or if you have only recently logged in. Make sure there is only one of the given cape you want to augment in your inventory. For example if you are intending to augment an ogma's cape, there should only be one ogma's cape in your inventory. The go command takes a number as an input that represents the number of times you wish to augment your cape. It is possible you will lose your thread,dust,sap and dye if you enter a number that would take your augment past its possible maximum. For example suppose you have an ogma's cape already augmented with Dex+5 from a thread item. After using the //ct prep run thread dex command you enter //ct go 20 command. There is a safeguard that will stop the augmentation process after augmenting your cape 15 times. However it is highly recommended that you enter the exact number of times you need to max a particular augment path just in case. It is also possible to lose augment items if you try to augment a cape with a different path than is already present. Suppose again you have an ogma's cape augmented with DEX+5 via threads. If you enter the //ct prep run thread str and then the //ct go 15 command intending to augment your cape with str, you might lose these 15 threads . There is now a safeguard to avoid this, but it is highly recommended you make sure your intended augment path already matches what is on the cape. Make sure you do not move items around your various inventory bags while the augmentation process is ongoing. You can mess around with your inventory after you get the ending message, otherwise you might interrupt the augmentation process and need to reload the addon. The augmentation process can occasionally stall. If this ever happens you can use the //ct r command to reload the addon and start the process over again. Suppose you want to augment an ogma's cape from scratch with dex, accuracy and attack, and double attack. You can use the following steps: Enter //ct prep run thread dex Enter //ct go 20 Wait for the ending message Enter //ct prep run dust acc/atk Enter //ct go 20 Wait for the ending message. Enter //ct prep run sap doubleattack Enter //ct go 10 Upon receiving the completion message you can then consider augmenting another cape. Commands help The help command displays all of the possible commands of CapeTrader in your chat windower. Below are the equivalent ways of calling the command: //ct help //ct h //capetrader help //capetrader h reload The reload command reloads the addon. Useful if the capetrader addon ever gets stuck during the augmentation process. The below are equivalent: //ct reload //ct r //capetrader reload //capetrader r unload The unload command reloads the addon. Useful if the capetrader addon ever gets stuck during the augmentation process or you want to unload the addon quickly. The below are equivalent: //ct unload //ct u //capetrader unload //capetrader u prep The prep command is one of the key components of this addon's function. This command tells the go command how to augment your cape. There are three inputs to the prep command. First is the 3 letter abbreviation of the job on the cape, for example: cor blm whm pup. The second is the type of augment item you need to use: thread, dust, sap and dye. Third is the augment path. Note that none of these inputs are case sensitive. Also in case you are not sure exactly what to input for the augment path, you can use the list command or use the following list for reference. Below are all of the possible combinations of valid augment paths: //ct prep war thread hp //ct prep mnk thread mp //ct prep whm thread str //ct prep blm thread dex //ct prep rdm thread vit //ct prep thf thread agi //ct prep pld thread int //ct prep drk thread mnd //ct prep bst thread chr //ct prep brd thread petmelee //ct prep rng thread petmagic //ct prep sam dust acc/atk //ct prep nin dust racc/ratk //ct prep drg dust macc/mdmg //ct prep smn dust eva/meva //ct prep blu sap wsd //ct prep cor sap critrate //ct prep pup sap stp //ct prep dnc sap doubleattack //ct prep sch sap haste //ct prep geo sap dw //ct prep run sap enmity+ //ct prep war sap enmity- //ct prep mnk sap snapshot //ct prep whm sap mab //ct prep blm sap fc //ct prep rdm sap curepotency //ct prep thf sap waltzpotency //ct prep pld sap petregen //ct prep drk sap pethaste //ct prep bst dye hp //ct prep brd dye mp //ct prep rng dye str //ct prep sam dye dex //ct prep nin dye vit //ct prep drg dye agi //ct prep smn dye int //ct prep blu dye mnd //ct prep cor dye chr //ct prep pup dye acc //ct prep dnc dye atk //ct prep sch dye racc //ct prep geo dye ratk //ct prep run dye macc //ct prep war dye mdmg //ct prep mnk dye eva //ct prep whm dye meva //ct prep blm dye petacc //ct prep rdm dye petatk //ct prep thf dye petmacc //ct prep pld dye petmdmg go The go command is the second key component of the CapeTrader addon and requires that you have used the prep command correctly beforehand. Remember again that using this command carries with it some risks as described in the usage notes section. If you do not provide an input the go command will by default only augment your cape once. Below are equivalent ways of augmenting your cape 20 times: //ct go 20 //capetrader go 20 list The list command is used as a reminder of what are valid inputs for the augmentpath input of the prep command. Below are the equivalent ways of calling this command: //ct list //capetrader list //ct l //capetrader l Packet Warnings and Notes There are four parts to the process of augmenting your ambuscade cape: Part 1: Targetting gorpa-masorpa plus putting together and trading the relevant items. This takes me about 10 seconds to complete manually. (Involves outgoing packet 0x036) Part 2: Waiting for the dialog menu to pop up and become usable. This takes about 1 second and can't be controlled by the player. (Involves the incoming 0x034 packet.) Part 3: Navigating the menu to confirm and augment your cape. This takes me 2-3 seconds to confirm manually. (Involves 2 outgoing 0x05B packets) Part 4: Waiting and receiving your newly augmented cape. This takes anywhere from 1 to 3 seconds and can't be controlled by the player. (Involves the incoming 0x01D packet) The cape trader addon uses packets in order to substantially speed up parts one and three from above at a speed that would not normally be possible. Therefore if you use this addon you could potentially look suspicious. Part 1 of the process takes only 1 second using this addon. If this makes you uncomfortable you can change the value of the dustSapThreadTradeDelay and dyeTradeDelay variables in the capeTrader.lua file to a more reasonable amount if you wish. Please note that the augmenting with dyes needs a bit longer of a delay to work. This addon does part 3 pretty much instantaneously once the incoming 0x034 packet is received from part 2. So once again you can look suspicious again during this stage. The time it takes for part 2 and 4 should not be that different from you augmenting capes manually. The possibility of the loss of augment items comes from part 3. When augmenting manually you will get denied by the npc if you try to trade an already maxed cape. Injecting the 0x036 packet and later the 0x05B packets bypasses this check but you lose your augment items but receive your cape back unchanged if you have already maxed an augment path. There are some safeguards to prevent this happening in this addon but it has not been tested on every single augment path. So please use the go command with caution. Please keep all of the above in mind before deciding to use this addon. If you do decide to use CapeTrader I hope you find it useful!

To build the initial list, you must login and logout (or input the \"findall\" command) at least once with each of them. The list is stored on the machine on which the addon is executed, being updated everytime you look for an item or on logout, so this will not work the best if you use multiple PCs, at least until IPC will let them communicate over LAN or Internet (in development). The addon has a deferral time of 20 seconds when it's loaded, you are logging in or zoning to give the game enough time to load all the items. If you notice that this time is too short, please create an issue report in the bug tracker. It also offers an on-screen tracker that keeps track of items you specify or of your used/free space in specified bags. Commands findall findall Forces a list update. search findall [:<character1> [:...]] <query> [-e<filename>|--export=<filename>] Looks for any item whose name (long or short) contains the specified value on the specified characters. * character1: the name of the characters to use for the search. * ...: variable list of character names. * query the word you are looking for. * -efilename or --export=filename exports the results to a csv file. The file will be created in the data folder. Examples findall thaumas Search for \"thaumas\" on all your characters. findall :alpha :beta thaumas Search for \"thaumas\" on \"alpha\" and \"beta\" characters. findall :omega Show all the items stored on \"omega\". Tracker The settings file has a field that you can use to define what is being tracked in a text box on the screen. The text supports variables denoted by curly braces preceded by a dollar sign ${} . Each variable consists of two parts, the bag indicator and the item name, separated by a colo : . For example, to track the amount of shihei in your inventory, you would do this: <Track> ${inventory:shihei} </Track> This will merely display a number on the screen. You can add flavor text outside of the variable: <Track> Shihei: ${inventory:shihei} </Track> You can also use wildcards for item names: <Track> Crystals: ${inventory:*crystal} </Track> You can use any of the bag names defined here as well as the key word all to search all bags. Every variable name is case-insensitive. There are a three variables that can be used instead of item names: $freespace , $usedspace and $maxspace If those are used, the respective value will be displayed: <Track> Inventory: ${inventory:$freespace}, Wardrobe: ${wardrobe:$freespace} </Track> Formatting Since the tracker uses XML for formatting and XML is shitty, this will not work: <Track> Inventory: ${inventory:$freespace} Satchel: ${satchel:$freespace} Sack: ${sack:$freespace} Case: ${case:$freespace} Wardrobe: ${wardrobe:$freespace} </Track> The spaces and new lines will all collapse into a single space and you'll get one long and unreadable line. To make the format appear as you have it in the XML settings file you need to wrap the entire text in <![CDATA[ and ]]> tags: <Track> <![CDATA[Inventory: ${inventory:$freespace} Satchel: ${satchel:$freespace} Sack: ${sack:$freespace} Case: ${case:$freespace} Wardrobe: ${wardrobe:$freespace}]]> </Track> That will correctly preserve any formatting you have inside the text. With that, you can even do something like this: <Track> <![CDATA[Inventory: ${inventory:$usedspace||%2i}/${inventory:$maxspace||%2i} \u2192 ${inventory:$freespace||%2i} Satchel: ${satchel:$usedspace||%2i}/${satchel:$maxspace||%2i} \u2192 ${satchel:$freespace||%2i} Sack: ${sack:$usedspace||%2i}/${sack:$maxspace||%2i} \u2192 ${sack:$freespace||%2i} Case: ${case:$usedspace||%2i}/${case:$maxspace||%2i} \u2192 ${case:$freespace||%2i} Wardrobe: ${wardrobe:$usedspace||%2i}/${wardrobe:$maxspace||%2i} \u2192 ${wardrobe:$freespace||%2i}]]> </Track> TODO Use IPC to notify the addon about any change to the character's items list to reduce the amount of file rescans.

Similar to GearCollector; uses packets. For the purpose of this addon, a bag is: \"Safe\", \"Storage\", \"Locker\", \"Satchel\", \"Sack\", \"Case\", \"Wardrobe\", \"Safe 2\". For commands that use a filename, if one is not specified, it defaults to Name_JOB.lua, e.g., Rooks_PLD.lua For commands that specify a bag, if one is not specified, it defaults to all, and will cycle through all of them. The addon command is org , so org freeze will freeze, etc. This utility is still in development and there are at least a couple of known issues (it does not always move out gear that is currently equipped, argument parsing could be better). It is designed to work simplest as a snapshotting utility (freeze and organize without arugments), but it should work no matter what you want to do with it. Settings auto_heal Setting this feature to anything other than false will cause Organizer to use /heal after getting/storing gear. bag_priority The order that bags will be looked in for requested gear. dump_bags The order that bags will be filled with unspecified gear from your inventory. item_delay A delay, in seconds, between item storage/retrieval. Defaults to 0 (no delay) Commands Commands below are written with their arguments indicated using square brackets, but you should not use square brackets when entering the commands in game. Default options are italicized. Freeze freeze [bag] [filename] Freezes the current contents of a bag or all bags to the specified filename or Name_ShortJob.lua in the respective data directory/directories. This effectively takes a snapshot of your inventory for that job. So using //org freeze as a Dancer named Pablo would result in freezing all of your bags in files named Pablo_DNC.lua. Get get [bag] [filename] Thaws the frozen state specified by filename or Name_ShortJob.lua and bag or all bags and makes one attempt to move towards that state. Tidy tidy [bag] [filename] Thaws a frozen state specified by filename or Name_ShortJob.lua and bag or all bags and makes one attempt to purge anything currently in inventory that shouldn't be into dump bags. Organize organize [bag] [filename] Thaws a frozen state specified by filename or Name_ShortJob.lua and bag or all bags and executes repeated Get and Tidy commands until a steady state is reached (aka. you have your gear). With no arguments, it will attempt to restore the entire thawed snapshot. Gearswap Integration Additionally, Organizer integrates with GearSwap.

It is useful to note that LuaCore does not have access to a list of the currently loaded plugins/addons, so this addon's strategy is to assume that the config file is a complete list of all plugins/addons that may be loaded. It unloads plugins/addons that are not in all profiles when it is first loaded or when you log off a character. Then it reloads the appropriate plugins/addons for the current character when you log in. This load/unload cycle means that individual init.txt customizations will be lost on plugins/addons that are not loaded on all accounts, unless they also use a config file that goes by character name. Most plugins/addons do at this point, but some still don't. Features Reads a config file and issues the proper load/unload commands for each profile.

Allows for significantly more organization than the in-game menu. Usage This addon has no commands. Loading it will create an icon with four rhombi. Each rhombus indicates the region where clicking will open a menu. Starting at the top-most rhombus and moving clock-wise, the menus that will open are: weapon skills (green), magic (red), job abilities (blue), and pet commands (yellow). The menu can be repositioned by holding down shift and clicking anywhere within the icon. Creating Custom Menus Upon load or log in, the following files are searched for and loaded if found: P:/ath/to/Windower/addons/Rhombus/data/spells_template.lua P:/ath/to/Windower/addons/Rhombus/data/ws_template.lua P:/ath/to/Windower/addons/Rhombus/data/ja_template.lua P:/ath/to/Windower/addons/Rhombus/data/pet_command_template.lua P:/ath/to/Windower/addons/Rhombus/data/spell_aliases.lua Each file is expected to return a table. The first four files create the structure of the corresponding menus, while the fourth is a simple mapping of in-game spell or ability names to custom names. (You might use it to rename 'Goblin Gavotte' to 'Resist Bind', for example. Renaming spells and abilities within the menus has no effect on how they are sent as commands.) To create a menu, simply list the spell ids (obtained from windower's resources) that you want to appear. If you want to create a sub-menu within that menu, add a key/value pair to your table with key 'sub_menu' and a table as the value. List each sub-menu as you would like it to appear in your menu within the sub_menu table. Values in the sub_menu table must be strings to avoid conflicts. To add spells to a sub-menu, create a key with the same name as the sub-menu in the table that contains the sub_menu key. Sub-menus may also contain sub_menu keys: there is no limit to the number of sub-menus you can create. The ja_template, ws_template, and pet_command_template files work only slightly differently than the spells_template file. The table returned by each of these files should have keys corresponding to each in-game job's name that you want to create a menu for. These keys should have table values which will contain the structure of the menu as described above. In the event that no file is found for a template, the default values from memory will be used. If a table within that file (in the case of job abilities, weapon skills, and pet commands) is found for either your main or sub job, but not both, the remaining abilities found in memory will be appended to the menu you constructed. If both tables are found, the menus will be merged with sub-menus and contents appearing in order. Example menus can be found at the following location: https://github.com/trv6/Windower4/tree/master/Rhombus%20examples Using the Mouse Left-clicking on the rhombus icons opens the corresponding menu, or closes it if the menu is already open. New menus can be opened without closing the current menu, and if a menu is closed by opening a new menu rather than by clicking a second time on the corresponding rhombus, the position within that menu will be saved. The next time the menu is opened, it will open to the saved location rather than the beginning of the menu. Left-clicking a menu item will input the ability or spell to the console, while left-clicking with the shift key held down will do the same but with the (hopefully) appropriate subtarget command appended. Note that in order for left-clicking to work properly, the shortcuts addon must also be loaded. Right-clicking on the menu will travel back one menu, or close the menu if the base menu is open. Right-clicking on the rhombus icon will close the currently opened menu, saving the position within the menu. Only 12 menu items can be displayed at a time. The rest may be scrolled to using the scroll-wheel of your mouse.

This allows you to type text in Japanese. In order to use it, Japanese language support must be installed, and Japanese must be selected as the default non-unicode language in Windows. Using IME I wrote this to help those that can actually speak Japanese but have little knowledge in the means of making their computer let them type it in FFXI. If you're here trying to find out how to get the emoticons to show up, you'll have to find someone else to teach you, or learn to read hiragana and katakana before asking me. If you're already able to type Japanese on your computer, then obviously you already have the IME installed, so this first section is not for you. Go down to II. Configuring the IME Installing the IME Control Panel Languages Tab Control Panel > Regional and Language Options > Languages Tab Install files for East Asian languages must be checked. If not, check it at this time. You WILL require your Windows XP CDs in order to install this option. Tough luck if you don't have them, you can't download these files for XP. Pre-XP (ie. Win98) users CAN download them because it was never included with the windows installation CDs. Do a search on Microsoft's site, and make sure you don't mistake the ones designed for MS Office. Once you're done installing and rebooting, come back to this window. Control Panel Advanced Tab Control Panel > Regional and Language Options > Advanced Tab Language for non-Unicode programs You have two options for this, both with their own quirks: - Japanese, or - English (using AppLocale on Windower) Japanese Setting it to Japanese will cause minor quirks to appear in many of your windows programs (the most prominent being that all your backslashes will appear as Yen symbols), however it will let Windower run as intended. A future update to Windower or the IME plugin should allow you (according to replies from Cliff in other threads) to set this back to English and Windower will take care of the rest. English (AppLocale) If you don't want to set your system's locale to Japanese, you also have the option of using a program provided by Microsoft known as AppLocale . AppLocale basically does what the above option does, except it only does it to the one program you want to run in the Japanese locale, instead of your entire system. When you run AppLocale by itself, it'll ask you what program to run, and at the end if you want to create a shortcut for it. Of course, creating a shortcut saves you the trouble of constantly going through this wizard in order to run the Launcher. Where does it drop it? In Start > Programs > AppLocale . From there you can drag/drop/cut/copy/paste it to wherever you like; Quick Launch, Desktop, another directory in your Start Menu... There is one problem with using AppLocale right now though. The FFXI window will be in a mode called \"Always on Top\" and as stated it will always be on top of other windows. It also removes the titlebar and borders from the window so you can't move or resize it. For this reason most of you will want to use option (a), unless you're a power user and run dualies (like myself). With regard to the borderless and \"Always on top\" mode when using AppLocale, I have had success with using the FFXI official windowed mode to reapply the border. If you enable the official windowed mode in FFXI Config (and save settings), you may then use AppLocale with launcher.exe to use all of windower's features, as well as a window border and the ability to minimize/place windows on top of the game. I did however experience a bug wherein the game had to first be minimized before I could enter chat text... but that is a minor bug... Control Panel Details Button Control Panel > Regional and Language Options > Languages Tab > Details This brings up the Text Services and Input Languages window. The Default input language can be whatever you want, but most English users will want to leave it on English. Basically it changes the default language that the Language Bar will start in for all programs. In the area below that, labelled Installed services, you need to have two, possibly three, entries to use the Japanese IME. If you haven't Installed files for East Asian languages from 1. then you can't install the services required. JP Japanese > Keyboard > Microsoft IME Standard 2002 ver 8.1 (or variation thereof) Microsoft Natural Standard 2002 ver 8.1 (or variation thereof) Japanese (optional) If these do not appear in the list yet, Add them. You may have to restart. Once you've done that, then you have everything you need to start using the IME. Note: In the Advanced Tab of this window, ensure the checkbox under Compatibility Configuration is not checked. This will prevent the selection menu from appearing, as well as cause discrepancies in using pre-defined key combinations. Configuring the IME There are two ways to bring up the Text Services and Input Language window: i. Regional and Language Options >> Languages Tab >> Details button ii. From the Language Bar, click on the tiny little down arrow button >> Settings Changing Language without the Mouse Many users use the mouse to click on the language bar to change the modes it's in. You can configure the Language Bar with shortcuts so you don't have to do this. Assuming the IME is installed, click on Key Settings from the Text Services and Input Language window. Depending on how many languages you already have installed, more than two to four options may appear here. We are only interested in two in particular - that is to switch the language to Japanese, and switch to English - however users that can speak/read/write more than one language may want to change more than this option in a similar manner. The observant person may notice that an option may appear with a frequently mentioned key sequence of ALT + SHIFT . Pressing this key sequence will cause the Language Bar to cycle through the installed languages (if you have just English and Japanese, it'll switch between the two whenever you press it). If this is not the case, it may be why some suggestions appearing in the forum are not working for you. We'll remedy this immediately: Select Switch to Japanese and click the Change Key Sequence button. Now here, you're free to change the key sequence to whatever you like, just as long as you can remember it in the future. Do the same for switching to English, as you will occassionally need to do so when your input mode gets stuck. Personally, mine is set to CTRL + SHIFT + 1 (with the option to switch back to English as CTRL + SHIFT + 0 ; multilingual users may want to arrange their languages to other numbers, or whatever). Now whenever you press CTRL + SHIFT + 1 (or whatever you set yours to) the IME will change to JP. You're pretty much done with this window now, and are ready to start using the IME. Using the IME The IME is quite an amazing tool, and it takes a lot of patience, practice and knowledge to be able to use it effectively. There are also a lot of shortcuts available that make changing modes easier (or saving you the trouble of doing so), and there are just as many odd quirks that cause the IME to behave in inexplicable ways. When you first switch the language to JP (using whatever key sequence you set up above), the Input Mode default to \"direct input\". This means that the IME will not do any transliteration for you as you type (FFXI will show the mode as \"off\" in it's first box to the right of the input line when this is the case). Press ALT + ~ (tilde) to turn the IME on. You may have to hold it for a moment, since FFXI misses modifier keys at times, especially on slower computers. If this does not work after several attempts, you have failed to turn off Extend support of advanced text services to all programs . Or you're just weird or something. Having this option enabled will also prevent the candidate menu from appearing when you press the spacebar. Ctrl+~ should work for you instead, for the time being. Again, no candidate window until you change that setting. In FFXI's language bar, the \"off\" should turn to an \"on\", and the \"A\" beside it should turn into the hiragana equivalent. You are now in hiragana mode, and there are ways of changing to katakana, and full- and half-width alphanumeric modes. The second box beside the \"Off/On\" in FFXI's language bar will change to reflect the mode you're in. The other modes you don't want to sit in because it's quite frankly annoying. There's another way to change your input into these formats, and it's much easier than changing your mode. Since I rarely change my input mode (aside from turning the IME on/off using ALT + ~ ), I don't know the exact key combonations for each one. But using the CAPS LOCK key in conjunction with ALT , SHIFT or CTRL will change your mode. IIRC, ALT + CAPS LOCK will change the mode to hiragana. This much is good to know when you find all your input defaulting to katakana. When you're typing your sentences in Japanese, it's generally much easier to do it a little bit at a time. A word followed by a particle, or a word comprised of compound-kanji. Type this, hit space to find the correct candidate, then press enter to select it. Move on. This prevents unexpected transliterations to appear, and it's generally time consuming to move back through your input to correct it. The annoyed user will press Escape far too many times, resulting in only more annoyance after losing all the green text, or the entire input bar. Your new input typically appears as green. Sometimes the rest of it will appear in yellow depending on how much you type in. When you hit spacebar, the IME will attempt to locate the parts of the sentence and transliterate them best it can. Selection is shown by green, while the rest of your input is yellow. Sometimes the IME selects the groups of your entry wrong, having taken too much or too little of the reading. Holding shift and pressing left or right will detract from or extend the current selection, at the same time turning it back to hiragana until you press space to attempt another transliteration. Don't press space if you don't want it to try turning it into kanji. If you've found the right candidate and there's more you need to correct, press left or right to move to the next/previous group. Otherwise press enter and it'll change your entry to white, signifying that you're done with the transliteration. Yes, you need to press enter twice if you just want to type English. Get used to it, you can't change this behavior. If you need a part of your text to appear in katakana, type it in first, then press the F7 key. Voila, you have katakana. Many of the keys from F5 to F12 will change your current input to a different mode. In FFXI, many of these won't seem to have an effect, but that's because FFXI doesn't accept half-width input. I don't remember what each one does off-hand, so playing with them is your best bet to learning what each of them do. (I know that somewhere along F10 to F12 will change your current input to straight roma-ji). Beware of F1 to F4 if you still have Extend support of advanced text services to all programs enabled. You can possibly freeze and/or crash FFXI since the Windows IME commanderes FFXI when the IME Tools open. Added: There tends to be only one shift key that works when typing kana in FFXI, which is usually the left one. If one doesn't work, try the other. This only happens when the IME is turned on. Both keys work as normal when you're not typing kana. After you run into this a few times it becomes almost second nature to keep using it. This has something to do with Japanese keyboards only have one shift key, or so I hear. There are multiple ways of typing in English without having to turn the IME off entirely. As mentioned above, somewhere between F10 and F12 will change your input to roma-ji. Therefore, you can type your entire sentence in hiragana mode and hit the appropriate F-key. Pressing it multiple times changes the case of the letters. Secondly, and a bit of a quirk at times, either pressing the Shift key once (can't remember which), or Shift and another letter (\"I\" for example, for those that have good habits in their written English), will change the mode to Alphanumeric. The shift method though, I believe, defaults to full-width which is the odd-looking wide characters. You'll probably end up pressing the F-key at the end anyways or turning off the IME. Just know that this quirk exists. If this happens and you didn't want it to, hit escape once to clear the green text and start typing again. There are cases where you'll get stuck in certain modes. If this happens, and you've tried to change the mode back to hiragana using the above methods, AND pressing ALT + ~ multiple times to turn the IME on and off doesn't work, then this is where you should have set up a key sequence that turns Windows' Language bar back to English. ( CTRL + SHIFT + 0 in my case) Doing that, then turning it back to Japanese should clear up any such problems. If not, beat your fist into it's fontface (read: you're SOL until you restart FFXI). FFXI remembers what mode you left off in. By pressing CTRL + L (linkshell), CTRL + R (reply), or CTRL + P (party), FFXI will recall and have you continue typing in that mode. This behavior is programmed into the IME, so you have to deal with it. However, if you type /s, /sh, /l, or /p first, the mode defaults to Direct Input . Actually, ANYTHING you start with a / will keep the IME off until you turn it back on or press enter. It does this because even the Japanese have to type commands as their English equivalents.","title":"IME"},{"location":"plugins_v4/ime/#using-ime","text":"I wrote this to help those that can actually speak Japanese but have little knowledge in the means of making their computer let them type it in FFXI.

AppLocale basically does what the above option does, except it only does it to the one program you want to run in the Japanese locale, instead of your entire system. When you run AppLocale by itself, it'll ask you what program to run, and at the end if you want to create a shortcut for it. Of course, creating a shortcut saves you the trouble of constantly going through this wizard in order to run the Launcher. Where does it drop it? In Start > Programs > AppLocale . From there you can drag/drop/cut/copy/paste it to wherever you like; Quick Launch, Desktop, another directory in your Start Menu... There is one problem with using AppLocale right now though. The FFXI window will be in a mode called \"Always on Top\" and as stated it will always be on top of other windows. It also removes the titlebar and borders from the window so you can't move or resize it. For this reason most of you will want to use option (a), unless you're a power user and run dualies (like myself). With regard to the borderless and \"Always on top\" mode when using AppLocale, I have had success with using the FFXI official windowed mode to reapply the border. If you enable the official windowed mode in FFXI Config (and save settings), you may then use AppLocale with launcher.exe to use all of windower's features, as well as a window border and the ability to minimize/place windows on top of the game.

You can configure the Language Bar with shortcuts so you don't have to do this. Assuming the IME is installed, click on Key Settings from the Text Services and Input Language window. Depending on how many languages you already have installed, more than two to four options may appear here. We are only interested in two in particular - that is to switch the language to Japanese, and switch to English - however users that can speak/read/write more than one language may want to change more than this option in a similar manner. The observant person may notice that an option may appear with a frequently mentioned key sequence of ALT + SHIFT . Pressing this key sequence will cause the Language Bar to cycle through the installed languages (if you have just English and Japanese, it'll switch between the two whenever you press it). If this is not the case, it may be why some suggestions appearing in the forum are not working for you. We'll remedy this immediately: Select Switch to Japanese and click the Change Key Sequence button. Now here, you're free to change the key sequence to whatever you like, just as long as you can remember it in the future. Do the same for switching to English, as you will occassionally need to do so when your input mode gets stuck. Personally, mine is set to CTRL + SHIFT + 1 (with the option to switch back to English as CTRL + SHIFT + 0 ; multilingual users may want to arrange their languages to other numbers, or whatever). Now whenever you press CTRL + SHIFT + 1 (or whatever you set yours to) the IME will change to JP.

There are also a lot of shortcuts available that make changing modes easier (or saving you the trouble of doing so), and there are just as many odd quirks that cause the IME to behave in inexplicable ways. When you first switch the language to JP (using whatever key sequence you set up above), the Input Mode default to \"direct input\". This means that the IME will not do any transliteration for you as you type (FFXI will show the mode as \"off\" in it's first box to the right of the input line when this is the case). Press ALT + ~ (tilde) to turn the IME on. You may have to hold it for a moment, since FFXI misses modifier keys at times, especially on slower computers. If this does not work after several attempts, you have failed to turn off Extend support of advanced text services to all programs . Or you're just weird or something. Having this option enabled will also prevent the candidate menu from appearing when you press the spacebar. Ctrl+~ should work for you instead, for the time being. Again, no candidate window until you change that setting. In FFXI's language bar, the \"off\" should turn to an \"on\", and the \"A\" beside it should turn into the hiragana equivalent.
